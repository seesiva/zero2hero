## Understanding the Code

Here is the code snippet you provided, cleaned up a bit for clarity:

```python
h = 0.0001

# Inputs
a = 2.0
b = -3.0
c = 10.0
d = a * b + c

# Changing the value of 'a' slightly
a += h
d2 = a * b + c

print('d before change:', d)
print('d after change:', d2)
print('slope:', (d2 - d) / h)

Explanation in Simple Terms
Think of it this way:

Imagine 
𝑑
d is how much fun you have, and 
𝑎
a is how much time you spend playing.
Initially, you have a certain amount of fun.
You spend a tiny bit more time playing.
You notice how your fun changes.
The "slope" or derivative tells you how quickly your fun is increasing or decreasing with more playtime.
In your code:

You start with a certain fun level (d).
You increase your playtime by a tiny bit (h).
You calculate the new fun level (d2).
The difference between the new and old fun levels, divided by the tiny increase in playtime, tells you how quickly your fun changes with time.
This is what derivatives do in calculus: they measure how much one thing changes in response to changes in another thing.
