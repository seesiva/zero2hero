## Understanding the Code

Here is the code snippet you provided, cleaned up a bit for clarity:

```python
h = 0.0001

# Inputs
a = 2.0
b = -3.0
c = 10.0
d = a * b + c

# Changing the value of 'a' slightly
a += h
d2 = a * b + c

print('d before change:', d)
print('d after change:', d2)
print('slope:', (d2 - d) / h)

Explanation in Simple Terms
Think of it this way:

Imagine 
d is how much fun you have, and 
a is how much time you spend playing.
Initially, you have a certain amount of fun.
You spend a tiny bit more time playing.
You notice how your fun changes.
The "slope" or derivative tells you how quickly your fun is increasing or decreasing with more playtime.
In your code:

You start with a certain fun level (d).
You increase your playtime by a tiny bit (h).
You calculate the new fun level (d2).
The difference between the new and old fun levels, divided by the tiny increase in playtime, tells you how quickly your fun changes with time.
This is what derivatives do in calculus: they measure how much one thing changes in response to changes in another thing.


## Understanding the Code

### Class Definition: `Value`

1. **Class Declaration:**
   ```python
   class Value:
This line defines a new class named Value. A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances of the class) that can have attributes (data) and methods (functions).

2. **Initializer Method:**
   ```python
 __init__:
def __init__(self, data):
    self.data = data

The __init__ method is a special method in Python known as the initializer or constructor.
It gets called when a new instance of the class is created.
The self parameter refers to the instance being created.
The data parameter is passed when creating a new instance, and self.data = data assigns this value to the instance's data attribute.

3. **Representation Method: __repr__:**
```python
def __repr__(self):
    return f"Value(data={self.data})"
The __repr__ method is another special method that defines how an instance of the class is represented as a string.
f"Value(data={self.data})" uses an f-string to return a string that includes the class name and the value of the data attribute.
